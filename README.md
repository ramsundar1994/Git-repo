# Cloud Academy Website

This is a complete, mobile-responsive website package for Cloud Academy.

## Features
- **7 Pages**: Home, About, Courses, Guidance, Testimonials, Contact, Register.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on phones, tablets, and desktops.
- **Modern Theme**: Professional Cloud Tech blue and white palette.
- **Easy Updates**: Navigation is managed in `main.js`, so you only edit it once to update links on all pages.

## How to Edit
1. **Text & Images**: Open any `.html` file (e.g., `index.html`) in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code) and change the text inside tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, etc.
2. **Colors**: Edit `style.css`. Look for the `:root` section at the top to change colors globally.
3. **Menu Links**: Edit `main.js` to add or remove links from the `headerHTML` section.

## How to Host
Since this uses standard HTML/CSS/JS, you can host it anywhere:
- **Drag and Drop**: Netlify Drop, Vercel.
- **Standard Hosting**: Upload all files to your `public_html` folder via FTP.
- **Local**: Double-click `index.html` to view it on your computer.
